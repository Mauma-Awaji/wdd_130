        <h1 id="page-title">Path to the Pokémon League</h1>

        <div class="words">Earning all 8 gym badges gives you access to the Pokémon League where you face off against the Elite Four. Beyond them lies the final frontier on your path to Pokémon mastery: the Champion. Defeating them all lets you become the new Kalos Champion. The members of the Elite Four can be challenged in any order but be warned! A single loss against any of them or the champion means you’ll have to restart the entire Pokémon League challenge from the beginning.
